title: "ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models â€” From Scratch"
description: >
  A collection of classic and modern Machine Learning models implemented **from scratch** using Python and NumPy.
  This repository is designed for learners and practitioners who want to deeply understand how ML algorithms work
  behind the scenes â€” without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

overview:
  motivation: >
    Most tutorials teach how to use machine learning libraries, but not how they actually work.
    This repository aims to bridge that gap by building each algorithm from first principles,
    including mathematical intuition, cost functions, optimization steps, and evaluation metrics.
  goals:
    - Reinforce core ML math and algorithmic intuition.
    - Implement models using only NumPy for computations.
    - Visualize performance and compare theoretical vs practical understanding.

  example_usage: |
    # Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/machine-learning-models.git
