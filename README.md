# 🧠 Machine Learning Models from Scratch

A curated collection of **Machine Learning models implemented entirely from scratch** using **Python** and **NumPy** —  
no `sklearn.LinearRegression`, no TensorFlow, no PyTorch shortcuts.  

Each project demonstrates the **core mathematical intuition**, **gradient-based optimization**,  
and **hands-on implementation** of key ML algorithms.

## 📚 Models Included

| Model | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| 🔹 **Linear Regression** | Predicts continuous values using gradient descent optimization. |
| 🔹 *(Coming Soon)* **Logistic Regression** | Classification model using sigmoid activation and cross-entropy loss. |
| 🔹 *(Coming Soon)* **Decision Tree** | Recursive tree-based model for regression and classification. |
| 🔹 *(Coming Soon)* **K-Means Clustering** | Unsupervised clustering based on centroid optimization. |

## 🧩 Project Philosophy

> 🧮 “Understanding Machine Learning starts with coding the math yourself.”

Each model in this repository:

- Uses **NumPy** for vectorized computation.  
- Avoids built-in ML abstractions.  
- Follows a consistent structure:

model.py → Implementation
train.py → Data generation & training
README.md → Theory + Code explanation

yaml
Copy code
