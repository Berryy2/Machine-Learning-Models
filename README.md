#🧠 Machine Learning Models from Scratch

A curated collection of Machine Learning models implemented entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy — no sklearn.LinearRegression, no TensorFlow, no PyTorch shortcuts.
Each project demonstrates the core mathematical intuition, gradient-based optimization, and hands-on implementation of key ML algorithms.

📚 Models Included til now
Model	Description
🔹 Linear Regression	Predicts continuous values using gradient descent optimization.
🧩 Project Philosophy

🧮 “Understanding Machine Learning starts with coding the math yourself.”

Each model in this repository:

Uses NumPy for vectorized computation.

Avoids built-in ML abstractions.

Follows a consistent structure:

model.py → Implementation

train.py → Data generation & training

README.md → Theory + Code explanation

🚀 How to Run
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/machine-learning-models.git
cd machine-learning-models/linear_regression

# Run the model
python linear_regression.py

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
